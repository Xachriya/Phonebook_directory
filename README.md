in this code I have used hashmaps to store contacts in memory then accessing them using a key 
A Hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values. The keys are used to find the corresponding values in the table. The main idea behind a Hashtable is to use a hash function to map the keys to an array index, so that the values can be stored in an array. The hash function takes the key as input and returns an array index where the value can be stored.
A hash function is a function that takes an input (or 'key') and returns an output (or 'hash value'). The main goal of a hash function is to take an input of any size and return an output of fixed size. This output is used as an index of the array, where the values are stored. The hash function should have the following properties:
It should be deterministic, meaning that the same input should always produce the same output. It should be fast to compute. The output should be uniformly distributed across the array indices. The process of insertion in Hash table is simple. First, it uses the key to calculate the index using the hash function. Then it inserts the key-value pair at the calculated index. While searching for a value, it uses the same key to calculate the index and retrieve the value from that index.
Class Phonebook
                               The class defines a phonebook class that uses a HashMap to store phone book entries. The class consists of several methods for adding, removing, updating, and printing phone book entries.The addContact() method takes in four parameters (full name, phone number, address, and email) and creates a new phonebookentry object. It then uses the put() method of the HashMap class to add the object to the map, with the full name as the key and the phonebookentry object as the value.The remove() method takes in one parameter (the full name of the contact) and uses the containsKey() method of the HashMap to check if the key is present in the map. If it is, it uses the remove() method of the HashMap to remove the entry.The replace() method also takes in four parameters (full name, phone number, address, and email) and creates a new phonebookentry object. It then uses the containsKey() method of the HashMap to check if the key is present in the map and if it is, it uses the replace() method of the HashMap to replace the old entry with the new one.The printSingleEntry() method takes in one parameter (the full name of the contact) and uses the containsKey() method of the HashMap to check if the key is present in the map. If it is, it uses the get() method of the HashMap to retrieve the value (the phonebookentry object) associated with the key, and prints it.The toString() method uses a StringBuilder to create a string representation of the phonebook, including a list of all the contacts. It iterates over the values of the map using the values() method of the HashMap, and appends each phonebookentry object to the StringBuilder.
Overall, this class uses a HashMap to store phone book entries and provides methods to add, remove, update and print entries in the phone book.
Class PhonebookEntry
                               The class defines a phonebookentry class that represents a single entry in a phonebook, with a full name, phone number, address, and email. The class has several methods to access the phonebookentry's fields, and a toString() method to create a human-readable representation of the entry.The class has four fields: full_name, phone_number, address, and email, which are all private and can only be accessed using the class's methods.
The class has a constructor that takes in four parameters and assigns them to the class's fields.The class has four methods getFull_name(), getPhone_number(), getAddress(), and getEmail(), that returns the respective fields.
The toString() method creates a string representation of the contact, including their full name, address, email, and phone number.
The compareTo() method compares this phonebookentry to another based on their full names, a negative number if this phonebookentry's full name comes before the other's alphabetically, 0 if they are the same, or a positive number if this phonebookentry's full name comes after the other's alphabetically.
This class creates an entry in the phonebook which contains all the information about a contact, it then provides the functionality to get the information about the contact, compares the contact based on full name and provides a human-readable representation of the contact.
Class User
                               The class creates an instance of the phonebook class and performs several operations on it. The addContact() method is used to add three contacts to the phonebook.Then the phonebook is printed.
Then the remove() method is used to remove a contact from the phonebook and then the phonebook is printed.Then the replace() method is used to update a contact from the phonebook and then the phonebook is printed
Then the printSingleEntry() method is used to print a single contact based on the full name and it takes the full name as a parameter.
This class creates an instance of phonebook and perform the operations on it such as adding the contact, removing the contact, updating the contact and printing the contact.
